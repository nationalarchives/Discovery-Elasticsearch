 (Digital Records Infrastructre) Updates

This script has been created to update DRI records in MongoDB Records Collection and to re-index the records in
Discovery.

The script takes data from an excel spreadsheet, updates both test and live MongoDB instances and then sends the
corresponding IAIDS to the search index Api, to re-index those records in Discovery.

if there are any then delete the columns. If they hold data they'll have to be updated manually or the Python script.
